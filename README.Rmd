# ROCFTP.MMS

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ROCFTP.MMS is to generate perfect sample from a given posterior. It takes a posterior, and generates two Markov chains by Metropolis with a multishift proposal. This proposal is monotone and forces these two Markov chains started from the two extreme points of the most interest range to be coalesced. This mechanism is used in ROCFTP to generate a perfect sample.

## Installation
