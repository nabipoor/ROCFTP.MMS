0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is the second submission. There were no ERRORs, WARRNINGS, and NOTEs. The note of "checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE", coming from check_rhub(). The spell of ROCFTP and multishift are correct.

## Other comments
* This package is part of a new paper which will submitted soon; however, a previously published summer research by two of authors of this package established the method which used in this package, and it referenced in the Help document.
